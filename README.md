soo well how TO PUT DA MOD:
GET KADE ENGINE 1.8 PLS 
and UNZIP THE RAR wth any program that like 7zip or winrar.
Unzip the folder to mods folder and youre done!
If you didint read the first release or tag, its a Kade Engine Port.
If it does not work, Make a issue and put it as an issue. Also yes it can be for other engines?
I dont know. The 2nd way is just googling BF reanimated and download the v2 and but the bf sprites, xml in KadeEngine/assets/shared/characters.
